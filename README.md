## How to play

The player to pick two cards of their choosing. If the cards have the same rank (two diamonds, for example), the player keeps the pair. If not, the cards are returned to their face-down position. Play until all the cards have been matched.

At the end of the game it will be shown how much time you have taken and its performance, which is measured by the number of stars. Stars decrease according to the amount of movement they needed to win.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
